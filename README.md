# ranger-fzf

[Ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger) plugin that allows navigation with [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf).

Copied from the Ranger wiki [here](https://github.com/ranger/ranger/wiki/Custom-Commands) so it can be installed with [ranger-plug](https://github.com/cjbassi/ranger-plug).

Forked from cjbassi's [ranger-fzf](https://github.com/cjbassi/ranger-plug) is it is no longer maintained.

Modified a bit to so that :fzf is all files and dirs, and :fzfD is only dirs
